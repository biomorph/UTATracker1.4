        <p>
			<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>ROUTE</strong></span></p>
		<p>
			This tab finds all vehicles on an inputted UTA route (2,6, 72 etc). For Trax use 701 - <span style="color:#0000FF;">Blue Line</span>, 703 - <span style="color:#FF0000;">Red Line</span> and 704 - <span style="color:#008000;">Green Line</span>.</p>
		<p>
			If the typed route number is valid, a map with pins denoting vehicles&#39; position is displayed.</p>
        <p> The pins are color coded <span style="color:#FF0000;">red</span> or <span style="color:#800080;">purple</span> depending on the direction of the vehicle. </p>
		<p>
			The map also displays the route shape in <span style="color:#FF0000;">red</span>. If you click the vehicle pins you can see the name of the route and the direction the vehicle is traveling. Also displayed is the vehicles' &quot;on-time&quot; status (colored dot)</p>

            <span style="color:#808080;">Light Gray Colored Dot : Vehicle is &gt; 10 min early</span></p>

		<p>
			This tab finds the <strong>25</strong> closest stops &nbsp;to your current location and the routes/buses that stop there in the next <strong>60</strong> minutes.</p>
		<p>
			You can also filter the results to show only the route your are interested in (type this in the <strong>filter by this route</strong> field).</p>

		<p>
			If the typed route is valid, a map displaying closest stops that the route stops at are displayed on the map as pins.</p>
        <p> Selecting the refresh button on the map refreshes the map and shows the 25 closest stops to the center of the area of the map your are looking at.<p/>
        <p> Selecting the GPS button on the map shows you the 25 closest stops to your current GPS location <p/>
		<p>
			Selecting a pin brings up the stop address (900E @ South Temple etc) and the direction of the stop.</p>
		<p>
			Selecting the blue arrow on the pin brings up the buses that stop at the selected stop (<strong>in the next 60 minutes)</strong>, direction of the buses, arrival times and their timetables.</p>
        
        <p>
        <span style="color:#0000cd;"><strong>PLANNER</strong></span></p>
        <p> This tab brings up the google's amazing transit web app. Here you can plan your route without leaving the app. I also included a UTA button so you can plan your journey using UTA's website. </p>
        
		<p>
			<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOKMARKS</strong></span></p>
		<p>
			This tab displays the routes and stops your bookmarked in the route-show vehicles and the closest stops maps.</p>
		<p>
			Selecting a route entry brings up the route tab, searches for these vehicles and displays them on the map. If a stop entry is selected, buses that are scheduled to arrive at the stop in the next hour are shown.</p>
